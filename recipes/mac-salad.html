        <h2>About this Recipe</h2>
            <p>An easy 6 ingredient side dish that is hold the perfect <em>essence</em> of a
        summer day. This one is such a crowd pleaser that it was served at Becky's 
        Celebration of Life along with the recipe for those who wanted it.    
            </p>

            <p>While this recipe is simple in execution it's robust in flavor. And if you
                let this dish sit in the fridge over night it melds those flavors further
                and is <strong>100%</strong> better the next day!
            </p>

                <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> celery seed</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> red onion</li>

        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook pasta until 3/4's done. Drain and cool with cold water.</li>
                <li>Combine everything, mix and store mac and cheese in fridge as macaroni
                    continues cooking until finished</li>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>It's very important to only cook macaroni noodles 3/4's done. If you cook
                them more they will get soggy and mushy while in the fridge.</p>
